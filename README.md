eTAPAs
============================

eTAPAs is an Eclipse plug-in that provides tools for supporting specification and analysis of concurrent systems via Process Algebras. eTAPAs supports the use of process algebrae to specify and analyze concurrent systems. Systems are described as process algebras terms that are then mapped to Labelled Transition Systems (LTSs). Properties can be verified by checking equivalences between concrete and abstract system descriptions, or by model checking temporal formulae over the obtained LTS.

eTAPAs does not rely on a specific process algebra. Indeed, different process specification languages can be easily integrated in eTAPAs.
