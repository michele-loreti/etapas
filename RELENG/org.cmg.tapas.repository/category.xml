      eTAPAs is an Eclipse plug-in that provides tools for supporting specification 
 and analysis of concurrent systems via Process Algebras. eTAPAs supports the use of
 process algebrae to specify and analyze concurrent systems. Systems are described as 
 process algebras terms that are then mapped to Labelled Transition Systems (LTSs). 
 Properties can be verified by checking equivalences between concrete and abstract 
 system descriptions, or by model checking temporal formulae over the obtained LTS.
